# Logic carbon footprint modeling

`epa.json` provides electricity per unit area consumed by manufacturing
`gpa_99.json` provides carbon footprint of gases per unit area produced by manufacturing with 99% abatement
`gpa_95.json` provides carbon footprint of gases per unit area produced by manufacturing with 95% abatement
`materials.json` provides carbon footprint of procuring raw materials unit area consumed by manufacturing
`imec-netzero-cpa.json` provides carbon emissions equivalent of wafer manufacturing based on the Public version 4.0 imec.netzero tool, including Scope 1 direct gas emissions per unit area and Scope 2 indirect emissions from electricity use per unit area (kg CO2e / cm^2) but excluding Scope 3 indirect emissions per unit area from material procurement and others: https://netzero.imec-int.com/.
